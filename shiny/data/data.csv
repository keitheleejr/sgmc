This survey is anonymous. No one, including the researchers, will be able to associate your responses with your identity. Your participation is voluntary. You may choose not to take the survey, to stop responding at any time, or to skip any questions that you do not want to answer. There is an optional drawing for a gift card that participants can register for upon completing the first, anonymous, portion of the survey. Your personal responses will remain anonymous even if you wish to be registered for the gift card drawing. Participants must be at least 18 years of age to participate in this study.
